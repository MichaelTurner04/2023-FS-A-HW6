## Detailed Comments

-   You forgot several sets of parentheses, which caused compiler warnings
-   You created a `struct` to represent a point (position), but you still used 2 different objects for the x and y coordinates of each entity, which completely defeated the purpose of the `struct`s.
-   Your function documentation was mostly good
-   Matrix printing implementation
